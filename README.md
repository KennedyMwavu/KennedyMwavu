### What I Do
I'm a `self-taught` programmer specifically working as an R shiny developer.

I build production grade dashboards using [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for data analysis and interactive data visualization. 

Most often the process involves communication between the application and a database ie. performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

The good thing is that you can do all this from my dashboards, with zero database knowledge. So I do the heavylifting, you just have to worry about inputting the correct data.

### Lately

Recently, after work I engage in:
- 📖 Learning HTML, CSS & JavaScript. A combination of these with R Shiny is going to be bomb!💣
- 🌱 Writing on my blog. It's like a garden where I plant the best seeds I come across.
